## 📝 Notes

### Technical Decisions

- **Skip STORY-012/013**: Continue with current test setup, revisit later
- **Reuse DAG Code**: ~60% code reuse from Goal module saves time
- **Command Palette**: Use existing library (cmdk or Kbar)

### Risk Assessment

- **Medium Risk**: STORY-023 (DAG adaptation might need refactoring)
- **Low Risk**: STORY-026 (well-defined pattern)
- **Low Risk**: STORY-022 (straightforward data modeling)

### Buffer Planning

- 2 SP buffer for unexpected issues (already included in 24 SP)
- Can defer STORY-028/030/031 if needed (all P2)
